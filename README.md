# Valorant Login Caputre Demo

This is a demo workflow that's used in our app to capture the login token via official valorant website.

## Build
* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies with ```pnpm install```

Note that tauri build config is changed for this to work. Specifically the 'dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess' and 'withTauriGlobal'
